# My_Engine

My_Engine is a simple game engine built on top of the PyGame framework.

My_Engine makes it easy to create game entities and levels using only code.

## Installation

```
TBD... looking into making this a Pip package
```

## Quick Start

1. **Create a game entity** 

Entities are the lowest level element in My_Engine.

Entities can be dynamic characters like sprites, or static resources such as backgrounds.

See example [here](example/pong/player.py)

2. **Create a scene**

Scenes are essentially game screens or levels.

Scenes are made up of entities.

See example [here](example/pong/gameplay.py)

3. **Initialize the game**

Create your game's `main.py` file.

See example [here](example/pong/main.py)
